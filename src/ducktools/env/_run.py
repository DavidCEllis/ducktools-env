Short implementation of the `dtrun` command.

Unlike ducktools-env run, `dtrun` doesn't take any arguments other than the script name
and arguments to pass on to the following script.

This means it doesn't need to construct the argument parser as everything is passed
on to the script being run.

    # First argument is the path to this script
